# COMP7035_Week10_In_Class_Assignment
This is the culmination of my work for Week 10's in-class assignment for COMP7035, featuring a Java application that employs Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for enhanced input validation and date handling. I introduced aspects to streamline the validation of method arguments, focusing on date formats and value ranges, which are critical to the application's functionality.

With the strategic implementation of regex for format validation and logical checks to ensure date values are within acceptable ranges, the application mitigates errors early in the execution process. It features a singleton repository pattern for efficient file searching within a given date range, emphasizing a clean and maintainable coding approach.
